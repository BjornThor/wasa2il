"<p>\n"
"Polities are groups of people who come together to make decisions and enact "
"their will.\n"
"These are given various names depending on their form, structure, intent, "
"scale and scope.\n"
"Therefore they are variously called \"countries\", \"towns\", \"clubs\", "
"\"cabals\", \"mafias\", \"federations\",\n"
"\"treaties\", \"unions\", \"associations\", \"companies\", \"phyles\", "
"\"tribes\", \"counties\", \"regions\", \n"
"or any other of a number of different terms.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"The reason we use the word \"polity\" in Wasa2il is that it is the most "
"generic term we could\n"
"find. It says nothing of the form, the structure, the intent, scale or scope "
"of the group\n"
"of people, nor does it preclude anything. Using the word \"group\" could "
"work too, but it lacks\n"
"the imporant factor that there is an intent to make decisions and enact "
"will.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"In addition to consisting of a group of people, a polity will have a set of "
"laws\n"
"the group has decided to adhere to. In an abstract sense, membership in a "
"polity\n"
"grants a person certain rights and priviledges. For instance, membership in "
"a \n"
"school's student body may grant you the right to attend their annual prom,\n"
"and membership in a country (i.e. residency or citizenship) grants you a "
"right \n"
"to live there and do certain things there, such as start companies. stand "
"in \n"
"elections, and so on.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"Each polity has different rules - these are also called statutes, bylaws or "
"laws - \n"
"which affect the polity on two different levels.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"Firstly, there are meta-rules, which describe how rules are formed, how\n"
"decisions are made, how meetings happen, and how governance in general \n"
"happens. Wasa2il has to be flexible enough to accomodate the varying \n"
"meta-rules of a given polity, otherwise the polity may decide that Wasa2il "
"isn't \n"
"useful to them. Sometimes these rules are referred to as \"rules of procedure"
"\" \n"
"or \"constitution\", depending on the type of polity which is using them.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"Secondly there are external rules, which are the decisions the polity makes "
"which\n"
"don't affect its internal decisionmaking process.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"It is hard to talk about a term completely in the abstract. We can describe "
"its features, but\n"
"that only gets us so far. So let's look at some of the things that can vary "
"from one polity\n"
"to another, and then take a few examples in each.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<h2>Scope</h2>\n"
"<p>\n"
"The scope of a polity determines the range of things that the polity "
"concerns itself with. The\n"
"scope may be a geographic region, a set of ideas, a particular part of "
"social activity, or\n"
"a common interest of its members.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"<i>La Casa Invisible</i> is a social center in Málaga, Spain, which works in "
"the Málaga region\n"
"to promote ideas of social cohesion, autonomy, and democracy. It operates a "
"café, a book store,\n"
"a music hall, and various other projects, each of which could be considered "
"a sub-polity of\n"
"the social center itself. The scope of La Casa Invisible's actions is mostly "
"bound to decisions\n"
"regarding the social center itself, and the activities that take place "
"within it.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"<i>The Union of the Comoros (Udzima wa Komori)</i> is an island nation to "
"the east of Africa, \n"
"just north of Madagascar. It has a population of 798.000 people living in an "
"area of 2.235km². \n"
"The scope of The Comoros as a polity is the land and national waters they "
"control, their airspace,\n"
"and their foreign trade, defense and other agreements they are party to. As "
"such, they have\n"
"municipal sub-polities, and are a member of the African Union, Francophonie, "
"Organization of Islamic\n"
"Cooperation, Arab League and Indian Ocean Commission superpolities, amongst "
"others.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<h2>Scale</h2>\n"
"<p>\n"
"The scale of a polity determines how large it can be expected to become. "
"Some polities are specifically\n"
"structured with intent to grow, while others intentionally try to stay at a "
"constant size.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"<i>Muff Divers</i> is a diving club in the village of Muff in Ireland. It "
"claims to be the fastest\n"
"growing diving club in the world, most likely owing to its name.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<h2>Intent</h2>\n"
"<p>\n"
"A polity is created around intent. Some polities intend to take over the "
"world, others intend to make\n"
"the nicest cupcakes in all of the land. Some polities intend to send people "
"into space, and others\n"
"intend to track down and arrest criminals. Polities have all sorts of "
"motives and intents.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"On the most basic level, a polity's intent is a description of what it "
"intends to do. This has nothing\n"
"to do with whether the polity has the ability to do it, or whether anybody "
"or anything - such as another\n"
"polity, or the laws of physics - stand in their way.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"<i></i>\n"
"</p>\n"
"<h2>Structure</h2>\n"
"<p>\n"
"Representative democracy, direct democracy, participatory democracy, "
"dictatorship. There are lots of terms\n"
"which describe the structure of a polity. In one sense, it refers to where "
"in the structure of relations\n"
"between people the authority lies. In a dictatorship, one person has "
"ultimate authority, although he may\n"
"choose to grant some authority downstream to trusted advisors, who in turn "
"have trusted advisors, and so\n"
"on. In a fully egealitarian system, each individual is equipotent, meaning "
"he has an equal ability to\n"
"everybody else to instigate decisions - however, it depends on the structure "
"what ability the individual\n"
"has to actually complete the decision making.\n"

"Before members of a <a href=\"/help/polity/\">polity</a> can reach an <a "
"href=\"/help/agreement/\">agreement</a>, somebody needs to\n"
"propose something to be agreed upon. There are many ways in which a proposal "
"can come about - such as through a lone member\n"
"thinking about a problem, a group of people working together to solve a "
"problem, or couple of people brainstorming. Exactly\n"
"how people come up with ideas isn't really as important, for this "

"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"In Wasa2il, a user who realizes a problem can raise an <a href=\"/help/issue/"
"\">issue</a> in his polity. The issue belongs in\n"
"one or more of the <a href=\"/help/topic/\">topics</a> that the polity is "
"interested in. \n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"Depending on the purpose of the polity, a particular issue might not even be "

"is a golf club, it would be strange to raise an issue relating to a tennis "

"of thumb is, if there isn't a topic that your issue belongs in, then it's "

"<p>\n"

"members of the polity can work on a solution. The discussion is covered more "

"Rather than making a new agreement from scratch every time, which in the "

"<h3>Making changes to a proposal</h3>\n"
"<p>\n"
"When somebody has made a proposal, members of the polity might agree with it "
"in general but disagree with some specific points,\n"
"or think the wording or language needs some clean up. There are really only "
"four kinds of changes that are possible:\n"
"<ol>\n"
"\t<li>Remove a clause/statement from the document</li>\n"
"\t<li>Move a clause/statement within the document</li>\n"
"\t<li>Change a clause/statement in the document</li>\n"

"<h3>Voting on a proposal</h3>\n"
"<p>\n"
"In order for a proposal to be accepted, it needs to be <a href=\"/help/vote"
"\">voted</a> on in accordance with the rules of the polity.\n"
"Before the entire proposal can be voted on, the polity first needs to "

"<p>\n"
"Before members of a <a href=\"/help/polity/\">polity</a> can reach an <a "
"href=\"/help/agreement/\">agreement</a>, somebody needs to\n"
"propose something to be agreed upon. There are many ways in which a proposal "
"can come about - such as through a lone member\n"
"thinking about a problem, a group of people working together to solve a "
"problem, or couple of people brainstorming. Exactly\n"
"how people come up with ideas isn't really as important, for this "
"discussion, as what happens after the idea has come up.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"In Wasa2il, a user who realizes a problem can raise an <a href=\"/help/issue/"
"\">issue</a> in his polity. The issue belongs in\n"
"one or more of the <a href=\"/help/topic/\">topics</a> that the polity is "
"interested in. \n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"Depending on the purpose of the polity, a particular issue might not even be "
"appropriate - for instance, if your polity \n"
"is a golf club, it would be strange to raise an issue relating to a tennis "
"court on the other side of town. A good rule \n"
"of thumb is, if there isn't a topic that your issue belongs in, then it's "
"likely that the issue doesn't belong in the\n"
"polity. If you think that it is, perhaps you should raise the issue that "
"there are too few or overly narrow topics in \n"
"your polity!\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"Once an issue has been raised, there are two things that happen. First, "
"members of the polity can discuss the issue. Secondly,\n"
"members of the polity can work on a solution. The discussion is covered more "
"thoroughly elsewhere. Here, we focus on the\n"
"juicy bit: proposals!\n"
"</p>\n"
"<h3>Proposing a new agreement</h3>\n"
"<p>\n"
"In order to propose a new agreement, one makes a <a href=\"/help/document/"
"\">document</a> and attaches it to the issue.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<h3>Proposing changes to a previous agreement</h3>\n"
"<p>\n"
"Rather than making a new agreement from scratch every time, which in the "
"best case leads to redundancy, and in the worst case\n"
"can lead to internal contradictions, it is sometimes more appropriate to "
"propose changes to a previous agreement. These can be\n"
"minor changes, such as dropping a word, a sentence or a clause; or major "
"changes, such as restructuring the document in its\n"
"entirety or adding a new chapter.\n"
