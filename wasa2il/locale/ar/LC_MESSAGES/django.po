"\n"
"<p>\n"
"<a href=\"/help/polity/\">Polities</a> are groups of people who come "
"together to make decisions and enact their will.\n"
"The decisions they make collectively are <b>agreements</b>. An agreement is "
"generally made about a document, which\n"
"generally consists of a list of statements which the members of the polity "
"generally agree to.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"There's a lot of \"generally\" in there, because different polities do "
"things in different ways.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<h3>Conditions of adoption</h3>\n"
"<p>\n"
"Depending on the rules of the polity, different conditions may apply to how "
"an agreement gets accepted.\n"
"When an agreement has been accepted under the rules of a polity, it is "
"normally said that it has been \"adopted\".\n"
"In the most simple approach, if more than half of the members of the polity "
"who participate in a vote on the matter\n"
"agree, then the relevant document gets adopted.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>More complicated methods might require consensus (everybody agrees), some "
"other amount of support (say, 2/3), or\n"
"there could be a minimum number of members required to cast votes in order "
"for it to be adopted.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>A more obscure, but interesting condition, is \"rolling adoption\" - that "
"at every point in time, enough\n"
"members of the polity must accept the document for it to remain adopted, "
"otherwise it becomes \"unadopted\".\n"
"This requires that new members go through previous agreements and acccept or "
"reject them, otherwise they\n"
"might simply be aged out of the polity.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<h3>Document structure</h3>\n"
"<p>\n"
"Depending on the rules of the polity, an agreement document may have very "
"varying structure. A common example for international treaties is that "
"documents\n"
"consist of references to previous agreements, followed by a list of "
"assumptions made by the authors of the agreement, followed by a list of "
"declarations\n"
"which the signatory polities agree to. <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa."
"eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//NONSGML+WDECL+P7-DCL-2010-0047+0+DOC+PDF"
"+V0//EN&language=EN\">Here is a delightful example</a> - hover over "
"different parts to see what they're for.\n"

"in the fresh dairy \n"
"product category and can therefore contribute to the development of such "
"areas,</li>\n"

"appropriate - for instance, if your polity \n"
"is a golf club, it would be strange to raise an issue relating to a tennis "
"court on the other side of town. A good rule \n"
"of thumb is, if there isn't a topic that your issue belongs in, then it's "
"likely that the issue doesn't belong in the\n"
"polity. If you think that it is, perhaps you should raise the issue that "
"there are too few or overly narrow topics in \n"
"your polity!\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"Once an issue has been raised, there are two things that happen. First, "
"members of the polity can discuss the issue. Secondly,\n"
"members of the polity can work on a solution. The discussion is covered more "
"thoroughly elsewhere. Here, we focus on the\n"
"juicy bit: proposals!\n"
"</p>\n"
"<h3>Proposing a new agreement</h3>\n"
"<p>\n"
"In order to propose a new agreement, one makes a <a href=\"/help/document/"
"\">document</a> and attaches it to the issue.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<h3>Proposing changes to a previous agreement</h3>\n"
"<p>\n"
"Rather than making a new agreement from scratch every time, which in the "
"best case leads to redundancy, and in the worst case\n"
"can lead to internal contradictions, it is sometimes more appropriate to "
"propose changes to a previous agreement. These can be\n"
"minor changes, such as dropping a word, a sentence or a clause; or major "
"changes, such as restructuring the document in its\n"
"entirety or adding a new chapter.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<h3>Making changes to a proposal</h3>\n"
"<p>\n"
"When somebody has made a proposal, members of the polity might agree with it "
"in general but disagree with some specific points,\n"
"or think the wording or language needs some clean up. There are really only "
"four kinds of changes that are possible:\n"
"<ol>\n"
"\t<li>Remove a clause/statement from the document</li>\n"
"\t<li>Move a clause/statement within the document</li>\n"
"\t<li>Change a clause/statement in the document</li>\n"
"\t<li>Add a clause/statement to the document</li>\n"
"</ol>\n"
"All other actions are combinations of these four.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<h3>Voting on a proposal</h3>\n"
"<p>\n"
"In order for a proposal to be accepted, it needs to be <a href=\"/help/vote"
"\">voted</a> on in accordance with the rules of the polity.\n"
"Before the entire proposal can be voted on, the polity first needs to "
"resolve which version of the document it is voting on. This\n"
"is done by voting on all of the change proposals to the proposal "
"individually first.\n"
"</p>\n"
