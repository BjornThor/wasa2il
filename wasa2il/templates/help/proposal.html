<p>
Before members of a <a href="/help/polity/">polity</a> can reach an <a href="/help/agreement/">agreement</a>, somebody needs to
propose something to be agreed upon. There are many ways in which a proposal can come about - such as through a lone member
thinking about a problem, a group of people working together to solve a problem, or couple of people brainstorming. Exactly
how people come up with ideas isn't really as important, for this discussion, as what happens after the idea has come up.
</p>
<p>
In Wasa2il, a user who realizes a problem can raise an <a href="/help/issue/">issue</a> in his polity. The issue belongs in
one or more of the <a href="/help/topic/">topics</a> that the polity is interested in. 
</p>
<p>
Depending on the purpose of the polity, a particular issue might not even be appropriate - for instance, if your polity 
is a golf club, it would be strange to raise an issue relating to a tennis court on the other side of town. A good rule 
of thumb is, if there isn't a topic that your issue belongs in, then it's likely that the issue doesn't belong in the
polity. If you think that it is, perhaps you should raise the issue that there are too few or overly narrow topics in 
your polity!
</p>
<p>
Once an issue has been raised, there are two things that happen. First, members of the polity can discuss the issue. Secondly,
members of the polity can work on a solution. The discussion is covered more thoroughly elsewhere. Here, we focus on the
juicy bit: proposals!
</p>
<h3>Proposing a new agreement</h3>
<p>
In order to propose a new agreement, one makes a <a href="/help/document/">document</a> and attaches it to the issue.
</p>
<h3>Proposing changes to a previous agreement</h3>
<p>
Rather than making a new agreement from scratch every time, which in the best case leads to redundancy, and in the worst case
can lead to internal contradictions, it is sometimes more appropriate to propose changes to a previous agreement. These can be
minor changes, such as dropping a word, a sentence or a clause; or major changes, such as restructuring the document in its
entirety or adding a new chapter.
</p>
<h3>Making changes to a proposal</h3>
<p>
When somebody has made a proposal, members of the polity might agree with it in general but disagree with some specific points,
or think the wording or language needs some clean up.
</p>
<h3>Voting on a proposal</h3>
<p>
In order for a proposal to be accepted, it needs to be <a href="/help/vote">voted</a> on in accordance with the rules of the polity.
Before the entire proposal can be voted on, the polity first needs to resolve which version of the document it is voting on. This
is done by voting on all of the change proposals to the proposal individually first.
