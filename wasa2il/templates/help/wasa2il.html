<h1>{% trans "Help"%}: Wasa2il</h1>

<p>
Wasa2il is a participatory democracy software project. It is based around the core
idea of polities - political entities - which users of the system can join or leave, 
make proposals in, alter existing proposals, and adopt laws to self-govern.
</p>
<p>
The goal of this is to make it easy for groups on any scale - from the local 
whiskey club to the largest nation - to self-organize and manage their intents,
goals and mutual understandings.
</p>
<p>
The word "wasa2il" (pronounced "wasa'il") is from Arabic, where it means "means" - the
ability to accomplish something. The first part of the word, "wasa", means "liquid", which
appropriately describes the concept of liquid democracy. We like this mish-mash of meaning,
but if it doesn't mean much to you, don't worry - it's just a name. You can call it "Bob"
for all we care.
