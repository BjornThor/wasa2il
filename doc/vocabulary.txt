Wasa2il uses a partially controlled vocabulary. This vocabulary may vary 
from one language to the next, but the intent is that each word only has 
one meaning that is consistent across the entire system.

Words which do not appear on this list should not be considered controlled,
and can be used freely.

A word which is controlled MUST be used in any reference to an object of the
stated type, and SHOULD NOT be used in reference to any object of any other
type.
