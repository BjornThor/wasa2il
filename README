# wasa2il - ‫وسائل

Wasa2il is a participatory democracy software project. It is based around the core
idea of polities - political entities - which users of the system can join or leave, 
make proposals in, alter existing proposals, and adopt laws to self-govern.

The goal of this is to make it easy for groups on any scale - from the local 
whiskey club to the largest nation - to self-organize and manage their intents,
goals and mutual understandings.


## Polities

A polity is a political entity which consists of a group of people and a set of laws
the group has decided to adhere to. In an abstract sense, membership in a polity
grants a person certain rights and priviledges. For instance, membership in a 
school's student body may grant you the right to attend their annual prom,
and membership in a country (i.e. residency or citizenship) grants you a right 
to live there and do certain things there, such as start companies. stand in 
elections, and so on.

Each polity has different rules - these are also called statutes, bylaws or laws - 
which affect the polity on two different levels.

Firstly, there are meta-rules, which describe how rules are formed, how
decisions are made, how meetings happen, and how governance in general 
happens. Wasa2il has to be flexible enough to accomodate the varying 
meta-rules of a given polity, otherwise the polity may decide that Wasa2il isn't 
useful to them. Sometimes these rules are referred to as "rules of procedure" 
or "constitution", depending on the type of polity which is using them.

Secondly there are external rules, which are the decisions the polity makes which
don't affect its internal decisionmaking process.

Wasa2il needs to have the capacity to manage both types of rules and present
both in a coherent and comprehensive way. In particular, there needs to be an
available list of the laws which the polity has adopted, and changes to those
laws which have meta-effects must alter the way Wasa2il works for that polity.

## Topics

Within any polity, there can be any number of different topics that need to be
discussed. The members of a polity decide which topics are relevant to them.
The way in which this is decided depends on the meta-rules of the polity.
